			<!-- Content -->
			<p>My goal is to conceptualize and convey. If I'm learning, I'll be speaking or writing about it for others!</p>
            <p>I've spent most of my career as an infrastructure engineer, from datacenters to public cloud. Most of the time, you'll find me pairing with infrastructure engineers on code or application developers on systems. I enjoy open source projects, especially when it involves integrations with other ecosystems.</p>
            <p>Besides solving infrastructure puzzles, I'm a mentor and aspiring apartment gardener.</p>

					<p>As the author of <i><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/infrastructure-as-code-patterns-and-practices">Infrastructure as Code, Patterns and Practices</a></i>,
					   Rosemary Wang works to bridge the technical and cultural barriers between infrastructure, security,
					   and application development. She has a fascination for solving intractable problems
					   as a contributor, public speaker, writer, and advocate of open source infrastructure tools.
					   When she is not drawing on whiteboards, Rosemary debugs stacks of various
					   infrastructure systems on her laptop while watering her houseplants.</p>
