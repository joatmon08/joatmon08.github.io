			<p>My goal is to conceptualize and convey. If I'm learning, I'll be speaking or writing about it for others!</p>
            <p>I've spent most of my career as an infrastructure engineer, from datacenters to public cloud. Most of the time, you'll find me pairing with infrastructure engineers on code or application developers on systems. I enjoy open source projects, especially when it involves integrations with other ecosystems.</p>
            <p>Besides solving infrastructure puzzles, I'm a mentor and aspiring apartment gardener.</p>

					<h3>Speaker Bio</h3>
					<p>Rosemary Wang works to bridge the technical and cultural barriers between infrastructure
						engineers and application developers. She has a fascination for solving intractable problems
						with code, whether it be helping an infrastructure engineer learn to code or an application
						developer troubleshoot infrastructure failures. She also interfaces with vendors, clients,
						startups, and open source projects to find creative software solutions for infrastructure. When
						she is not drawing on whiteboards, Rosemary valiantly attempts to hack stacks of various
						infrastructure systems on her laptop while watering her houseplants.</p>
