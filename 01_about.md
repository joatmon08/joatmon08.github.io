			<!-- Content -->
			<p>My goal is to conceptualize and convey. If I'm learning, I'll be speaking or writing about it for others!</p>
            <p>I've spent most of my career as an infrastructure engineer, from datacenters to public cloud. Most of the time, you'll find me pairing with infrastructure engineers on code or application developers on systems. I enjoy open source projects, especially when it involves integrations with other ecosystems.</p>
            <p>Besides solving infrastructure puzzles, I'm a mentor and aspiring apartment gardener.</p>

					<h3>Speaker Bio</h3>
					<p>Rosemary Wang works to bridge the technical and cultural barriers between infrastructure, security,
					    and application development. She has a fascination for solving intractable problems
						as a contributor, educator, speaker, and writer of open source infrastructure products. When
						she is not drawing on whiteboards, Rosemary valiantly attempts to hack stacks of various
						infrastructure systems on her laptop while watering her houseplants.</p>
